# MK-Visual-Designer

This program simulates the RPG Studio MK environment and UI style, and acts as a visual designer for popup windows within that program. You can save UI designs, export them as simple C# code as used in RPG Studio MK to save time writing it, as well as import other people's UI designs. This program is completely tailored to RPG Studio MK, and contains only the features that I deem necessary.

This program is licensed under the GPLv3+ license.
